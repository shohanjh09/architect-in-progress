# ‚ùå Software Anti-Patterns

This document explains common **software anti-patterns** that reduce code quality, maintainability, and scalability. Recognizing these helps developers avoid poor design choices and refactor towards better solutions.

---

## üè¢ God/Manager Class
- **Definition**: A single class takes on too many responsibilities, becoming overly large and complex.  
- **Problems**:
  - Violates **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**.  
  - Hard to maintain and test.  
- **Solution**:
  - Break into smaller, cohesive classes.  
  - Apply **Separation of Concerns**.  

---

## üîÇ Singleton Overuse
- **Definition**: Excessive reliance on the Singleton pattern to manage shared state or global access.  
- **Problems**:
  - Leads to hidden dependencies.  
  - Makes testing difficult.  
  - Breaks modularity.  
- **Solution**:
  - Use **dependency injection**.  
  - Limit Singleton usage to truly unique resources (e.g., configuration, logging).  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overengineering
- **Definition**: Adding unnecessary complexity, abstractions, or features "just in case."  
- **Problems**:
  - Increases development time and maintenance burden.  
  - Introduces unused code.  
- **Solution**:
  - Follow **YAGNI (You Ain‚Äôt Gonna Need It)**.  
  - Implement only what is required.  

---

## üö® Programming by Exception
- **Definition**: Using exceptions to control normal program flow.  
- **Problems**:
  - Makes logic harder to follow.  
  - Reduces performance.  
- **Solution**:
  - Use exceptions only for exceptional cases.  
  - Apply proper conditional checks.  

---

## üëª Poltergeists
- **Definition**: Classes created only to pass data or invoke methods on other objects, without meaningful behavior.  
- **Problems**:
  - Adds unnecessary indirection.  
  - Wastes resources and complicates design.  
- **Solution**:
  - Remove and replace with direct calls or integrate logic into meaningful classes.  

---

## ‚öì Boat Anchor
- **Definition**: Retaining unused code, components, or frameworks in the system ‚Äújust in case.‚Äù  
- **Problems**:
  - Increases complexity.  
  - Confuses developers.  
- **Solution**:
  - Regularly remove unused or legacy code.  
  - Use version control for historical access.  

---

## üß© Interface Bloat
- **Definition**: Creating overly large interfaces with too many methods.  
- **Problems**:
  - Forces classes to implement methods they don‚Äôt need.  
  - Violates **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**.  
- **Solution**:
  - Break down large interfaces into smaller, role-specific ones.  

---

## üî® Golden Hammer
- **Definition**: Overusing a familiar tool, library, or design pattern for every problem.  
- **Problems**:
  - Ignores better solutions.  
  - Leads to suboptimal design.  
- **Solution**:
  - Evaluate tools/patterns based on context.  
  - Apply the **right tool for the job**.  

---

## ‚ö° Premature Optimization
- **Definition**: Optimizing code before identifying actual performance bottlenecks.  
- **Problems**:
  - Wastes time and effort.  
  - Makes code complex and unreadable.  
- **Solution**:
  - First, write clean, correct code.  
  - Optimize only after profiling reveals bottlenecks.
