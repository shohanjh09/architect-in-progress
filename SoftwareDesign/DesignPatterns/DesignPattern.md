There are three type of design patterns: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.
Creational Patterns: provide more flexibility in how the objects are actually created.
Structural Patterns: deal with how inheritance and composition can be used to provide extra functionality.
Behavioral Patterns: are about communication and assignment of responsibilities between our objects.

In summary, design patterns used to speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development models. You may not notice it or may
make use of it without knowing.
