# üîí Security-First Development

This document outlines the principles of **Security-First Development**, emphasizing secure coding practices, authentication/authorization patterns, and strategies to mitigate common vulnerabilities (including the **OWASP Top 10**).

## üõ°Ô∏è Secure Coding Practices

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
   - Use whitelisting instead of blacklisting.
   - Prevent injection attacks by parameterizing queries.
   - Example (Java PreparedStatement):
     ```java
     String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?";
     PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(query);
     stmt.setInt(1, userId); // Prevents SQL injection
     ```

2. **Output Encoding**
   - Encode output to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS).
   - Example: Use HTML entity encoding before rendering user input.

3. **Error Handling**
   - Avoid exposing stack traces and sensitive information.
   - Log errors securely and show generic error messages to users.

4. **Secure Dependencies**
   - Keep libraries and frameworks up to date.
   - Use tools like `OWASP Dependency-Check`, `npm audit`, or `composer audit`.

## üîë Authentication & Authorization Patterns

1. **Authentication**
   - Use secure protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect).
   - Store passwords securely (bcrypt, Argon2).
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).

2. **Authorization**
   - Follow the **Principle of Least Privilege (POLP)**.
   - Use **role-based access control (RBAC)** or **attribute-based access control (ABAC)**.
   - Deny access by default, explicitly allow only required actions.

3. **Session Management**
   - Use secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite cookies.
   - Regenerate session tokens after login.
   - Set appropriate session timeouts.

## üö® OWASP Top 10 & Mitigation

1. **Injection (SQL, NoSQL, OS Command)**  
   - Use parameterized queries and ORM frameworks.  

2. **Broken Authentication**  
   - Implement strong password policies, MFA, and secure session handling.  

3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**  
   - Encrypt data in transit (TLS) and at rest (AES-256).  

4. **XML External Entities (XXE)**  
   - Disable external entity processing in XML parsers.  

5. **Broken Access Control**  
   - Enforce strict RBAC/ABAC, deny by default.  

6. **Security Misconfiguration**  
   - Harden servers, disable unused features, use secure defaults.  

7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**  
   - Encode outputs, sanitize inputs, use CSP headers.  

8. **Insecure Deserialization**  
   - Avoid accepting serialized objects from untrusted sources.  

9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**  
   - Regularly patch dependencies, use vulnerability scanning tools.  

10. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**  
    - Enable audit logging, monitor for suspicious activity, integrate with SIEM.

## üèÜ Best Practices

- Adopt **‚ÄúShift Left Security‚Äù**: integrate security checks early in the SDLC.  
- Use **static application security testing (SAST)** and **dynamic analysis (DAST)** tools.  
- Conduct **regular code reviews** with a focus on security.  
- Perform **penetration testing** before release.  
- Provide **developer security training** to avoid common mistakes.

# ‚úÖ Conclusion

A **Security-First Development** approach ensures applications are resilient against threats by:  
- Writing secure code,  
- Enforcing strong authentication & authorization,  
- And protecting against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.  

By prioritizing security from the start, teams build software that is **safe, reliable, and trustworthy**.
