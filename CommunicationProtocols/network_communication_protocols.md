# üåê Network Communication Protocols

This document explains the fundamental **Network Communication Protocols** that form the backbone of the Internet and most modern networks: **TCP, UDP, and IP**.

## üì° IP (Internet Protocol)

- **Definition**: A network layer protocol that handles addressing and routing of packets between devices.  
- **Key Features**:
  - Provides logical addressing through **IP addresses**.
  - Defines packet structure and routing mechanisms.
  - Connectionless protocol (does not guarantee delivery).
- **Versions**:
  - **IPv4**: 32-bit addressing, supports ~4.3 billion unique addresses.
  - **IPv6**: 128-bit addressing, supports virtually unlimited addresses, includes improved security and efficiency.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Device identification on the Internet.
  - Routing packets across networks.
- **Example**:  
  `IPv4: 192.168.1.1`  
  `IPv6: 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`

## üîó TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

- **Definition**: A transport layer protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data.  
- **Key Features**:
  - **Connection-oriented**: Establishes a connection before data transfer.
  - Guarantees delivery through acknowledgments (ACKs).
  - Ensures packets arrive **in order**.
  - Performs error detection and retransmission.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS).
  - Email transfer (SMTP, IMAP, POP3).
  - File transfers (FTP, SFTP).
- **Example**:  
  Loading a webpage over `https://` uses **TCP port 443**.

## ‚ö° UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

- **Definition**: A transport layer protocol that enables fast, connectionless communication without guaranteeing delivery.  
- **Key Features**:
  - **Connectionless**: No handshake required.
  - Lower overhead and faster than TCP.
  - No guarantee of packet delivery or order.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Real-time applications (VoIP, video conferencing).
  - Online gaming.
  - Streaming services.
- **Example**:  
  Watching a live sports stream uses **UDP multicast**.

# üìä Protocol Comparison

| Protocol | Layer           | Connection Type   | Reliability | Speed | Typical Use Cases              |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|-------------|-------|--------------------------------|
| **IP**  | Network Layer   | Connectionless   | No guarantee| Medium| Routing, addressing            |
| **TCP** | Transport Layer | Connection-oriented | Reliable | Slower| Web, email, file transfers     |
| **UDP** | Transport Layer | Connectionless   | Unreliable  | Faster| Streaming, gaming, VoIP        |

# ‚úÖ Conclusion

- **IP** provides addressing and routing.  
- **TCP** ensures reliable, ordered communication.  
- **UDP** favors speed and efficiency at the cost of reliability.  

Together, these protocols enable the Internet to function by balancing **reliability** and **performance** across diverse applications.
