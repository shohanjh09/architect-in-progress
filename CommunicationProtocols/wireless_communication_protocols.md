## ðŸ“¶ Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity)

- **Definition**: A family of wireless networking technologies based on the IEEE 802.11 standards.  
- **Key Features**:
  - Provides high-speed Internet and local area network (LAN) connectivity.
  - Operates mainly in the **2.4 GHz** and **5 GHz** frequency bands (Wi-Fi 6 adds 6 GHz).
  - Supports high data rates (up to several Gbps with Wi-Fi 6/6E).
- **Use Cases**:
  - Home and office Internet access.
  - Public hotspots in cafes, airports, universities.
  - IoT device connectivity.
- **Example**:  
  Connecting a laptop or smartphone to a wireless router.

## ðŸ”µ Bluetooth

- **Definition**: A short-range wireless communication protocol for exchanging data between devices over short distances.  
- **Key Features**:
  - Operates in the **2.4 GHz ISM band**.
  - Low power consumption.
  - Variants:
    - **Classic Bluetooth**: Suitable for audio streaming and continuous data.
    - **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**: Optimized for IoT and low-power devices.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Wireless peripherals (mice, keyboards, headphones).
  - File sharing between devices.
  - Smart home devices and IoT sensors.
- **Example**:  
  Pairing wireless earbuds with a smartphone.

## ðŸ“² NFC (Near Field Communication)

- **Definition**: A short-range wireless communication protocol that enables two devices to communicate when they are within a few centimeters.  
- **Key Features**:
  - Operates at **13.56 MHz** frequency.
  - Range typically less than 10 cm.
  - Extremely low power, often powered by the reader device.
  - Provides secure, contactless communication.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Contactless payments (Apple Pay, Google Pay).
  - Smart cards and ticketing systems.
  - Device pairing by tapping.
- **Example**:  
  Tapping a phone on a payment terminal to complete a transaction.
