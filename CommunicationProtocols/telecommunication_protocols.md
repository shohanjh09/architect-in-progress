# üìû Telecommunication Protocols

This document provides an overview of key **Telecommunication Protocols** that power modern voice, video, and multimedia communication: **VoIP, SIP, and RTP**.

## ‚òéÔ∏è VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)

- **Definition**: A technology that enables voice communication and multimedia sessions over Internet Protocol (IP) networks instead of traditional phone lines.  
- **Key Features**:
  - Converts voice signals into digital packets transmitted over IP.
  - Cost-effective compared to PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network).
  - Supports voice, video, and text communication.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Internet-based calling services (Skype, WhatsApp, Zoom).
  - Enterprise telephony systems.
  - Replacing traditional landlines with IP phones.
- **Example**:  
  Making a WhatsApp voice call over Wi-Fi or mobile data.

## üì° SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)

- **Definition**: A signaling protocol used for initiating, maintaining, and terminating real-time communication sessions.  
- **Key Features**:
  - Handles call setup, management, and teardown.
  - Supports voice, video, messaging, and conferencing.
  - Works with RTP for media delivery.
  - Extensible and text-based, similar to HTTP.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Establishing VoIP calls.
  - Video conferencing solutions.
  - Unified communications platforms.
- **Example**:  
  SIP is used to set up and manage a Zoom or Microsoft Teams meeting.

## üé• RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol)

- **Definition**: A protocol designed for delivering audio and video over IP networks in real time.  
- **Key Features**:
  - Provides end-to-end delivery services such as payload type identification, sequencing, and timestamping.
  - Works with RTCP (Real-Time Control Protocol) for quality monitoring.
  - Usually runs over UDP for lower latency.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Streaming media.
  - Video conferencing and VoIP.
  - Online gaming with voice chat.
- **Example**:  
  RTP carries the actual voice packets during a VoIP call, while SIP sets up the call.

# üìä Protocol Comparison

| Protocol | Role                     | Transport | Typical Use Cases             |
|----------|--------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| VoIP     | Technology (umbrella term) | TCP/UDP  | Voice/video over IP           |
| SIP      | Signaling (session control) | TCP/UDP  | Call setup, conferencing      |
| RTP      | Media transport (audio/video) | UDP   | Real-time voice/video delivery|

# ‚úÖ Conclusion

- **VoIP** provides the overall framework for transmitting voice and multimedia over IP.  
- **SIP** manages the **signaling**‚Äîhow calls are started, maintained, and ended.  
- **RTP** ensures **real-time delivery** of the actual media streams.  

Together, these protocols form the backbone of modern telecommunication systems, enabling reliable and scalable voice and video communication across the Internet.
