# üè≠ Industrial and IoT Protocols

This document provides an overview of widely used **Industrial and IoT Communication Protocols**: **Modbus, CAN, and MQTT**. These protocols enable efficient communication in automation systems, vehicles, and connected devices.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Modbus

- **Definition**: A serial communication protocol developed in 1979 by Modicon for industrial automation systems.  
- **Key Features**:
  - Master-slave (client-server) communication model.
  - Simple and robust for industrial environments.
  - Supports communication over serial lines (RS-232/RS-485) and TCP/IP (Modbus TCP).
- **Use Cases**:
  - Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (**SCADA**) systems.
  - Industrial control systems (PLC, sensors, actuators).
  - Energy and utility monitoring.
- **Example**:  
  A PLC (master) requests sensor readings (slaves) using Modbus RTU.

## üöó CAN (Controller Area Network)

- **Definition**: A robust vehicle bus standard designed for communication between microcontrollers and devices without a host computer.  
- **Key Features**:
  - Multi-master, message-based protocol.
  - Very reliable with error detection and retransmission.
  - Real-time communication with low latency.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Automotive systems (engine, airbags, brakes, infotainment).
  - Industrial automation (factory robotics, machinery).
  - Medical devices.
- **Example**:  
  A car‚Äôs ECU uses CAN to coordinate communication between ABS sensors and braking system.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)

- **Definition**: A lightweight, publish-subscribe messaging protocol optimized for low-bandwidth and high-latency networks.  
- **Key Features**:
  - Runs over TCP/IP.
  - Designed for resource-constrained IoT devices.
  - Provides Quality of Service (QoS) levels for reliable delivery.
  - Uses a broker to manage communication between clients.
- **Use Cases**:
  - IoT applications (smart home, wearables).
  - Remote monitoring and control.
  - Telemetry data collection.
- **Example**:  
  A smart thermostat publishes temperature data to an MQTT broker; a mobile app subscribes to receive real-time updates.
